# GameWithMonsterWithID
A tools get data from GameWith.com and parse the data

GameWith is a good website which support MonsterStrike ,They have a powerful database about the detail information for monster ,**But only you can do is search with the monster's name,it's very difficult for someone can not read and input japanese.**
So,I download the data from the website ,and parse it ,let it can be searched by id(which you only can easy get from game).
This tool can help you to check the score in gamewith with monster's id.
